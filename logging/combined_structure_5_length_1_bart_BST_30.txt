Dialogue history: <PS>my favorite food is spaghetti and meatballs.<CTX>Spaghetti with meatballs.<SEP>Darn straight!  And there's a reason I said "American."  Though it may be inspired by Italian dishes, it was Italian-American immigrants that came up with the dish.<SEP>Really? That's pretty funny. I knew that Italian writers will mock the dish and say it's not really Italian. In Italy it's made only with an egg based pasta. Have you ever had the real stuff?<SEP>Nah, we never could afford the fancy things. Best I had was out of a can!<SEP>Well, you get experience points on that. Hopefully, the next dish is better.<SEP>I'm sure it would be if I could find a way to heat it up! Usually that makes it better.<SEP>You ate the dish cold?! That sounds vile, it really needs to be hot.<SEP>Yeah I did. But I was on my boat fishing at the time. I was in the middle of the lake and got hungry. That can was all I had.<SEP>I suppose if you're starving you wouldn't really care if its hot or cold. Why didn't you eat one of the fish that you caught?<SEP>Hadn't caught any yet. Plus they are hard to cook on a little boat. Do you eat raw fish?<SEP>Yes I suppose it would be hard to cook. I've had sushi which is raw, is it not?<SEP>Yeah, but I'm sure that didn't include the head did it?<SEP>Don't think it did, what is wrong with eating the head?
U--Not much if that's your thing. Never had the desire to try that myself!
