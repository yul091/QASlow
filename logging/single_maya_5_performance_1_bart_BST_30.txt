Dialogue history: <PS>my favorite food is spaghetti and meatballs.<CTX>Spaghetti with meatballs.<SEP>Darn straight!  And there's a reason I said "American."  Though it may be inspired by Italian dishes, it was Italian-American immigrants that came up with the dish.<SEP>Really? That's pretty funny. I knew that Italian writers will mock the dish and say it's not really Italian. In Italy it's made only with an egg based pasta. Have you ever had the real stuff?<SEP>Nah, we never could afford the fancy things. Best I had was out of a can!<SEP>Well, you get experience points on that. Hopefully, the next dish is better.<SEP>I'm sure it would be if I could find a way to heat it up! Usually that makes it better.<SEP>You ate the dish cold?!
